# Families of Foundation-Model Self-Play

## Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)

Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP) is the simplest variant within the Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP) paradigm, a novel family of policy search algorithms. FMSP aims to overcome limitations of traditional self-play (SP) algorithms, such as converging to local optima and failing to produce diverse solutions, by leveraging the advanced code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models (FMs).

vFMSP specifically focuses on continually refining agent policies through competitive self-play. It is characterized as a pure exploitation-driven algorithm, akin to FM-driven single-objective optimization but applied in a multi-agent context.
